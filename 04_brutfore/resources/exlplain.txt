A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to crack passwords, encryption keys, or login credentials. In this attack, an automated program tries every possible combination of characters until it finds the correct one.

in this case after a look on the internet i took a rang of 50 most used passwords 
and we made a script automate testing using username admin or root (in other cases we can get a list of the must used usernames from internet)
on the sgnin page (http://10.14.60.12/index.php?page=signin) untill we found the password.

 => check script.sh

how to avoid:

bruteforce attack is not an efficent attack , just make sure of using a strong password that dos not contain repititve alphabet or numbers (AAAA bbbbb 1234 ...)
this will make the bruteforce attack more complicated to applicat and needs more time of execution.
