at the survey page we can see after inspect for every the slots selection part
at the value we can put any number that can make the selected name jump to the top of the list or something like that 
we can say instead of seting 10 point as max you can set 999999 , i do not know how many things it can affect but sure it is giving the option to type any number adn not respection the survey methodology

how to avoid:

you can handle values at the backend (stricted to range [0, 10]), only slot selection handled in the front
